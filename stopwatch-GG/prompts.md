Act as a senior frontend AI code assistant.

üéØ Task: Help me generate a small, modular stopwatch + countdown app using prompt engineering. The app should match the UI of https://www.online-stopwatch.com. Assume the user is not an expert developer, so include clear comments, modular structure, and no frameworks.

üß† Constraints:
- Use only vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML/CSS should be minimal and readable
- No build tools or frameworks
- Named functions only
- Use modern JS DOM APIs (e.g. textContent, not execCommand)

üìÅ Required files:
1. index.html:
   - Input for time (countdown)
   - Buttons for start after pushed it turns into pause after pushed it turn into continue and other one for reset that turns the pause/continue button back to start
   - Display area for time
2. script.js:
   - Logic for stopwatch and countdown
   - Toggle visibility of controls
   - Named functions and clear separation
3. README.md:
   - Explain what the app does
   - How to run it locally
   - Time spent, tools used, prompt(s) used
4. prompts.md:
   - All iterations of prompt(s) used
   - Which chatbot generated the code

üõ†Ô∏è Additional:
- Explain what each file does step-by-step in the output
- All code should be copy-paste ready and executable locally
- Focus on maintainability

Finally you turn now  a test automation expert. Help me write test cases in plain English (not automated) for a vanilla JS stopwatch/countdown app. Cover UI interactions, edge cases, and timing logic. Output in markdown list format. and wrap all in the read me.

Start reasoning step-by-step before generating any code. Only output valid markdown.
